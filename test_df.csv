131,rw8274464,Star Wars: Rogue One,7.8,10.0,"This film had the advantage of us as the audience having no attachment with the main characters. This allows the story tellers to create past and present lore that doesn't interfere with what we already knew.Rogue One beautifully weaves in and out of the pretellings of A New Hope without forcing jigsaw pieces in to places where it doesn't quite fit properly.The first part of the film is a little slow but builds up to the final 2 acts which are filled with excitement, adventure and emotion.As a fan, this film is in my top 3 (maybe joint).My only frustration, is why nobody from Disney learned anything as to why this film was a success when making all future developments. As of 2022, the only production close to ""doing it right"" is Mandalorian.If you haven't seen this film but love the originals, stop what you are doing and watch it.",0.051676802,0.38196087,0.5663623

However, thankfully, the film is instead a powerful and interesting look into the grittier 'war' side of Star Wars that represents well how terrifying the empire can be when you're just a normal individual instead of a force-wielding hero. It works perfectly as a standalone and thankfully will not ever be diminished by direct sequels.

It gives depth to A New Hope, but also to the whole rebellion and years fought, and because both the dark and heroic parts of the Alliance & Rebels are explored. Moreover, this is a movie worth seeing for its own catchy plot, full of revenge, family and quest for redemption.It's the proof that you can be original, you can be different, even break with established SW conventions (like the absence of the opening crawl), and still retain the REAL spirit of Star Wars.",0.0068692085,0.058750946,0.9343798

Well shot, well paced, and well acted, it's all the best parts of Hollywood cinema. Think of another time when a spinoff prequel made basically to address a plot hole/deus ex machina moment in a beloved 40 year old film was arguably better than the original. It's almost absurd. One of the best things to ever be put on film. BTW the scene at the end of the film is what everyone was waiting for for like 45 years. Literally made my day.

141,rw8134722,Star Wars: Rogue One,7.8,8.0,"I am a massive Star Wars fan who happened to be born in 2001. I was shown episodes I-VI at such a young age that I have no memory of watching them for the first time. Having missed the theatrical runs for all six movies, I was extremely excited to see what Disney was going to do with Star Wars. (As we all know now, my expectations were probably too high). When the force awakens was came out I thought it was good, although I was not very invested in the story. Then Rogue One came to theaters.Every scene had a weight to it. From the title card, to the epic chaos that is the last 30 minutes of this movie I was on the edge of my seat. The characters were determined, flawed, and relatable. (I was personally very happy to see a Mexican accent represented through Cassian's character). The movie was about sacrifice for the greater good and caring about something bigger than yourself. Classic themes from the original trilogy, done in a gritty and realistic way to evoke real world conflict without losing any of the fantasy of the setting. And this time the themes were explored within average soldiers, not just those in power- making it a perfect counterpart to the originals. The ending carried a lot of emotional weight and celebrated the unsung heroes of wars past and present. There are also many gorgeous and tragic shots throughout the movie, and the music is great.The movie isn't perfect of course. Characters like Bodhie and Baze could have used more development and Saw felt a bit out of place. The first 30 minutes are hard to follow on first watch. Moments like K2SO saying ""I have a bad feeling"" felt forced, the plot theme and situation of this movie had just enough of a connection to the rest of the universe. Adding dialogue in that way made it awkward.Overall this movie completely wowed me in the theater, and it had quality writing and visuals to back up its epic story. That's what Star Wars is about. For me this is the only Star Wars film that can firmly stand in discussion with the originals.",0.0054888,0.06297829,0.931533

I remember walking out of the cinema, distraught and full of loathing...Then episodes 2 and 3 came out...A little better but none could replace the effort that was put into 4,5 and 6.Then Disney took over:

143,rw8088475,Star Wars: Rogue One,7.8,5.0,This could have been an exciting story given that in the original Star Wars there was some mystery and build up behind the stealing of the plans and that's what this should have been. It should have been a journey and a race against time between the Rebellion and the Empire. Maybe even make it Star Wars' version of The Dirty Dozen. But sadly it wasn't. It takes too long to get to the main point of the story which is to steal the plans. Speaking of that the whole Galen Erso plot totally negates to me what happened in Star Wars. The idea was to analyze the plans to see if there is a weakness and if there was a way to destroy the Death Star. However Galen done that for them so there was no point to trying to see if they could destroy the Death Star because they knew they could with the right shot. By doing that you took away the suspense of whether or not the Rebellion could triumph. All in all what could have been a great suspenseful story was just average.,0.109258205,0.4473619,0.44337997

I was in shock how awesome was it. The concept of direct prequel for New Hope was something that no one asked, but everyone needed. I liked an idea that they left all of jedi concept out of that, so it could be something really new, different from main movies. Everyone in ""Rogue one"" squad was unique, there is a tank, blind guy etc. And the villain, oh the villain (Krennic) was amazing, the way how actor portrayed him was marvelous, you could really feel his emotions, that's why i can remember most of his lines.

155,rw7757717,Star Wars: Rogue One,7.8,10.0,"Rogue One is an all-new epic adventure directed by Gareth Edwards and written by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy. In a time of conflict, a group of unlikely heroes band together on a mission to steal the plans to the Death Star, the Empire's ultimate weapon of destruction. But this film is so much more than a prequel to A New Hope which revolves around the Rebellion trying to destroy the Death Star. With well written, morally grey and likeable characters, but also lots of characters from the prequel trilogy and the Clone Wars tv show; like Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, Saw Gerrera, Vader, Tarkin and a bunch of cameos. But it's the new ones that leaves a mark; characters like Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor, Orson Krennic, Galen Erso and K-2SO. The main cast consists of Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, Forest Whitaker, Riz Ahmed and Jiang Wen.Rogue One: A Star Wars story is Star Wars at its best because of many things, there's plenty of tension and suspension and the war genre is a big reason of it, the franchise was built on war and this film stays true to the war aspect and the director and his crew made a superb Star Wars film. It gives depth to A New Hope, but also to the whole rebellion and years fought, and because both the dark and heroic parts of the Alliance & Rebels are explored. Moreover, this is a movie worth seeing for its own catchy plot, full of revenge, family and quest for redemption. It was based on an idea first pitched by John Knoll ten years before the film entered development, Rogue One was made to be different in tone and style from the traditional Star Wars films, omitting the customary opening crawl and transitional screen wipes. Thus making the film more grounded and like a war movie as Edwards stated ""It's the reality of war. Good guys are bad. Bad guys are good. It's complicated, layered; a very rich scenario in which to set a movie."" Having critically acclaimed cinematographer Greig Fraser onboard makes for a stunning and literally mesmerizing film. Michael Giacchino is no John Williams but his musical score and orchestra brings a different yet similar in some way to the franchise, Michael's music fits the war genre and the story Rogue One is telling. The action sequences are all excellent, with the various of planets used, there are a sense of world building and expanding the galaxy. With planets like Jedha, Eadu and where the climax takes place, Scarif. The climax sequence on Scarif is some of the best Star Wars I've ever seen, what transpires there is what turned out to be the Rebel Alliance's first effective victory against the Empire, first referenced in A New Hope's opening crawl. There's some real emotional weight in Rogue One, the story is just superbly told. Gareth Edwards have created something memorable, something that's visually stunning and entertaining to look at.I've said that the well written characters are a huge reason why this film works so well, it's also the actors who play them who make them work on screen. Felicity Jones plays Jyn Erso, a flawed and human character that at first could be seen as a dislikeable character but what Rogue One does well is its character development that makes these morally grey and human characters into such interesting and ultimately characters. Other well acted performances are Diego Luna as Cassian Andor, a Rebel captain and intelligence officer, Ben Mendelsohn as Orson Krennic, the director of advanced weapons research for the Imperial military and Mads Mikkelsen as Galen Erso, Jyn's father and a research scientist. Whilst Forest Whitaker's role is smaller than I would have wanted as Saw Gerrera, a veteran of the Clone Wars and a friend of the Erso family who had mentored Jyn in her later childhood years. His presence is felt throughout the entire film, Whitaker's take on the character that have been in both Clone Wars and Rebels and now Fallen Order. He's still terrific in this film, playing this old man who have fought his entire life, it's a performance felt through his emotion. The comedic relief comes mostly from Alan Tudyk as K-2SO, a former Imperial enforcer droid who was reprogrammed by Cassian Andor to serve the Rebellion. But the character is also quite great, I just love the actor and the work he did for K-2SO.Rogue One has everything a film in this franchise needs to have and they do it perfectly. It brought us a spectacular and cinematic experience at the cinema but also back home, thinking back to my first viewing and now on my forth, it's still amazing. It's my first time watching it on 4k Bluray and it almost matches the experience at the cinema. It also spawned a prequel tv show called Andor which focuses on the title character's adventures in the rebellion before the events of Rogue One. My criticism is a spoiler so I won't go into detail but the film's flaw is the writing, but Gareth Edwards' makes up for it, it's mostly one decision the writers took but most of the dialogue were fixed during reshoots which saved the movie. Other than some of its writing, I think Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a strong candidate for one of the best Star Wars films.",0.017051093,0.43670923,0.5462397
